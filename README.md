# Board at desk - single dev description  #

Board at desk - single dev (B@D) is an effort to ease the deployment of KernelCI and LAVAv2 allowing
a developer with a board connected to its machine to test kernels. 
In order to do so, a VM has been created with all the tools and configurations required. 
The current technology used to create that VM is Vagrant. 

# Interesting links #

This is a list of links you should check if you are interested in B@D:

* Check what is new in the latest B@D release in the B@D [feature page](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/civilinfrastructureplatform/ciptestingboardatdesksingledevfeaturepage) and the instructions to deploy and configure B@D, connect the board to the VM and execute the reference tests.
