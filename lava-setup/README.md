This README is added here, since this directory contains /etc/lava-server/dispatcher-config/base-uboot.jinja2
file, which is one original from Lava version 2017.7 . It is important to note, since this file, replacing
original base-uboot.jinja2 from Lava version 2018.5.x, does make uboot to work seamlessly (without screambled
download order of zImage, initramfs.cpio.gz and am335x-boneblack.dtb).
