test.sh is /bin/bash shell script, vagrant provisioner, which seamlessly works for both bbb01 and iwg20m.

It'll work for ANY board, if the passthrough rules are obeyed!

The passthrough devices for both boards are created and execised in Vagrant builder.

There are two Vagrant builders:
[1] Vagrantfile.virtualbox used for initial VM creation.
[2] Vagrantfile used afterwards (CAUTION: these two files are different, and they overlap by the name (since Vagrantfile.virtualbox becomes Vagrantfile, so, PLEASE, rename Vagrantfile BEFORE executing VM creation!!!)
